---------- Question 4 ----------

1) Ground query - True
            field(hit_transfer, engineering)
            course(hit_transfer, mechanical)
            field(mechanical, engineering)
            true
2) Non-ground query - X = 10
            lab_number(fine_arts, 10)
3) Ground query - false
            course(computer, Z) no matches
            field(computer, literature) false
4) Non-ground query -
            X = hit-transfer, Y = mechanical
            X = web-design, Y = computer
            X = design-methods, Y = fine-arts ...
5) Ground query - True
            student(adrian, web_design) true
6) Ground query - True
          student(anna, engineering)
          field(mechanical, engineering)
          course(hit_transfer, mechanical)
          student(anna, engineering) true
7) Non-ground query -
          student(X, engineering)
          field(Z,engineering), student (X, Z)
          field(hit_transfer,engineering)
          course(hit_transfer,Z), field(Z,engineering)
          course(hit_transfer,mechanical)
          X = anna
          ...
          X=daniel
          X=adrian
8) Ground query - False
          no match for course(fine-arts,_)
9) Non-ground query -
          X = engineering
          X = engineering
          X = art
          X = social
          X = business
          will repeat because of (field(X,Y):-)
10) Non-ground query - False
          first atoms in field() facts don't match any second atoms of
          lab_number
11) Non-ground query -
          X = mechanical
          Y = engineering
          X = hit_transfer
          Y = engineering
12) Non-ground query -
          student(anna,hit_transfer)
          field(Z, hit-transfer), student(anna,Z) Z = mechanical
          X = anna , cut
          student(anna,_) X = anna
13) Non-ground query -
          student(anna), student(anna,_)
          X = anna, cut (ends procedure)
14) Non-ground query -
          the only course without a student is biology
          prolog will iterate through all possible course and not students
          combinations
          X = biology
